## What is this?
An experiment to see how much of an ELF binary executable can be stripped down without running into issues such as segmentation faults.

## What did we learn?
I've written a blog post to accompany this experiment which you can find [here](https://debugpin.io/posts/shrinking-binaries/).

TL;DR we got the binary down to a size of 138 bytes.
