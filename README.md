# inC

## What is this?
An experiment to see how much of an ELF binary executable can be stripped down without running into issues such as segmentation faults.

## Why inC?
To me, insy sounded like something very small and the term insy reminded me of [the classic nursery rhyme, Incy Wincy spider](https://wordsforlife.org.uk/activities/incy-wincy-spider/).
The project is spelt `inC` after the C programming language.

## What did we learn?
I've written a blog post to accompany this experiment which you can find [here](https://debugpin.io/posts/shrinking-binaries/).

TL;DR we got the binary down to a size of 138 bytes on a x86_64 system.
